# Shopping-Cart-CSC232
For my Object Oriented Software Development course, I built a Shopping Cart project. 

A Java Object-Oriented project that functions in the same way as a virtual shopping cart. A user may access the name and price of a specific Product object, as well as add and delete multiple Product objects from their Order cart object. The user can also obtain the whole final price of their order once it has been completed.
